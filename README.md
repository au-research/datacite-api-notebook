# DataCite API notebook

This repository contains a Python Jupyter notebook and associated files that can interact with the DataCite Member API to perform the following functions:

* Mint draft DOIs
* Publish draft DOIs
* Hide published DOIs
* Delete draft DOIs

Use of this notebook requires you to be a DataCite Member and have a username and password to access the API. This is the same username and password you use to
log into Fabrica.

See the notebook itself for embedded documentation on how to use it, including initial configuration.

It was developed on AARNet's CloudStor SWAN platform with the intention to remove as many barriers to reuse as possible.
